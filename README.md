# Big Query Lineage Sheet Generator
An automation tool which accurately finds the data lineage for views in a Google BigQuery dataset and places the result in a Google Sheet.

Data lineage is commonly used in data governance to improve risk management (i.e., ensuring that the correct access is provided to the end-users).

The tool was created because the risk of manual error increases when complex queries and long data lineage are involved - which is why it is necessary to automate the process.
